So, I recently ported a Fortran differential equation numerical
integration library to JavaScript, so I thought it would be fun
to see how fast it is in the browser. Here's Airy's differential
equation
<span class="equation" data-expr="y'' - xy = 0"></span>
. Hover the mouse over the graphs to perturb the initial
conditions. For each mouse motion we solve the DE from scratch
and plot it with d3.

Solution:
<div id='graph1'></div>
Phase space (parametric plot of y and y&prime;):
<div id='graph2'></div>

<script src="/public/js/odexdemo.js"></script>
<script>
  new s.Airy('graph1', 'graph2').draw();
</script>
