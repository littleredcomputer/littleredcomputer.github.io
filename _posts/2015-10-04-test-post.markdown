This **was** then.

Now we're back to regular old text. Hey ya. "This is the time," she
breathed, "and this is the record of the time." It's `like` this, and
like that ya know. This *is* now. Hey ya. "This is the time," she
breathed, "and this is the record of the time." It's `like` this, and
like that ya know. This *is* now. Now consider the en--dash, or
even---for the fatuous---the em dash. Do they work?

Fetch some data?

<div id="data"></div>
<div id="data2"></div>

<script src="/public/js/old-graph.js"></script>
<script>
 var g = new Graph({element: '#data', width: 600, height: 300});
 var h = new Graph({element: '#data2', width: 600, height: 300});

 function fetch(p, g) {
   d3.json("http://api.littleredcomputer.net/sicm/driven")
     .header('content-type', 'application/json')
     .post(JSON.stringify(p), function(err, data) {
       if (err) throw err;
       g.draw(data.value);
     });
 }

 fetch(P, g);
